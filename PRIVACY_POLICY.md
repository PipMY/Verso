## Introduction

Verso ("we," "our," or "the app") is a reminders application built for Android. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Reminder Data**: Titles, notes, dates, times, priority levels, and recurrence settings you create within the app.
- **Account Information**: If you choose to create an account, we collect your email address and password for authentication purposes.

### Information Collected Automatically

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

## Data Storage and Sync

- **Local Storage**: Your reminders are stored locally on your device by default and are accessible offline.
